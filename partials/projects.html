      This application is used to facilitate interactions between housemates. Roomies is built using the AngularJS framework. This
      application's database implements a NoSQL database through Firebase. Users are able to organize shopping trips, bill
      payments, chores, as well as chat with one another.

    <h3>Problems Encountered</h3>
    <div>
      <p>While designing the app, I originally did not realize the complex database structure that was required. In fact, I
        originally had very little experience using databases at all. I quickly realized that a flat database structure was
        essential to the performance of the application because Firebase does not allow for relationships between database
        entities. That being said, I began to attach a unique primary key to each "household" then assign that key to most
        items in the database, this ensured that items for each house were easily found through querying the database and
        searching for that specific foreign key. This repeated foreign key did make things difficult for users not only have
        a "house ID" assigned to them, they also have a unique "user ID". I found that sometimes I would query the database
        for the improper key, as well as apply the wrong foreign key to a new instance of an object, pushing these objects
        into a strange database limbo, this was quickly fixed.</p>
      <p>I found that there are some limitations when using firebase due to the none relational design of the database. However,
        the easy setup of the project made firebase valuable to the overall project. In the future, I look forward to using
        other nonSQL databases. </p>

      This application was inspired by my past career as a teacher. This application is used to document the attendance of students,
      and then create some basic analytics using chart.js. This app intends to allow for a more direct and consistent form
      of communication between teachers, administrators, students, and parents.

    <h3>Problems Encountered</h3>
    <div>
      <p>I originally planned for this project to be a cloud-based platform for teachers to document the grades and scores of
        their students. I even build a web based API using C#, and then the front-end was being built in Angular 2. All of
        this was hosted on Azure as well (<a href="https://github.com/garrett-vangilder/Socrates">You can find the source code here</a>).</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, that project ran into some problems, and I decided to change the course of the project and make an application
        that used established technologies (ASP.NET), which is how Aristotle was created. While writing Socrates; my original
        app, I found it very difficult to bypass some of the security features of Azure as there were several CORS issues
        associated with a public API. I was also bothered by the fact that the application could never actually be used due
        to FERPA legislation. This was the main reason the project was scrapped and reworked into Aristotle. Overall, I am
        happy with my application. It works well, and it is very interesting to see the data that can be collected and visualized
        through Chart.js.</p>

      Bangazon was a three-month long group project that lasted from the end of September 2016 till mid-December 2016. During this
      time several applications were created for an "Amazon" like company, Bangazon. These apps include several ASP.NET MVC
      applications that allow for end users to purchase and sell products, as well as an MVC applications that allow for
      Bangazon management to perform management tasks and document employee incidents. While working with my team, I learned
      a lot about implementing Agile methodologies into writing awesome high performing, well-documented code.
